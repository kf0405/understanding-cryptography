# Problems

1.  
    1. $e_k = y_i \equiv x_i + s_i mod 26$ and $d_k = x_i \equiv y_i - s_i mod 26$. The key stream can just be letters themselves, which will be transformed into numbers.

2.  
    1. Life cycle of key: the key can only be used for the transfer of 1Gbyte, storage of key during life cycle: the DVD must be protected from access from unauthorized access, after life cycle: key shouldn't be used after the 1Gbyte, as it becomes obsolete and loses its One time key purpose, key distribution: should be distributed securely by a trusted courier, key generation: must be generated by a true random number generator source, such as white noise.  

3.  
    1. If the key is used repeatedly, instead of just one time, as is its purpose, the attacker could simply intercept two ciphertexts and, as both share a key K, they would both involve a XOR'ing of the plaintext with the same key K. That means the attacker could derive the messages after finding the key through a system.

4.  
    1. An exhaustive key search will not work, as if we were to try all possible $2^40$ plaintexts derived from all $2^40$ possible keys, all results would be equally likely to be the real answer - there is no way to know which would be the correct one, and considering the enormous key-space, by trying to decrypt a word in english, we might find all other possible words with the same size.

5.  
    1. The plaintext: 4c 65 74 73 45 6e 63 72 79 70 74 54 68 69 73 42 6f 6f 6b = LetsEncryptThisBook  

6.  
    1. Two major drawbacks: requires a different key bit for every bit of the original message and the key should only be known to legitimate communication parties, so we can't send it through the Internet, we would need some other form of transportation for the key.
